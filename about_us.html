        <h3>Our collection</h3>
        <p>Our Library has developed an excellent collection of books, journals and non-book material in science, engineering, technology, humanities, social sciences and management. Collection building - a core activity of the library, has been undergoing a transformation. From print-only environment where all our acquisitions were in hard copy format, it has shifted to print-and-online and to online-only formats. The library currently subscribes to over 90% of its journals in online only format and the trend is likely to continue. However, most of books, both text and reference, are still preferred in print-only. The library collection comprising of books, journals, theses, reports, standards, pamphlets and other reading material as on March 2021 stands as follows :</p>
